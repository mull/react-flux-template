A simple, work in progress, template for starting of a ReactJS + Flux project with one clear goal: *no awful grunt or bower.*

Many things aren't done yet:
- envify for environments (i.e. development|staging|production etc)
- Backbone.JS for models & collections
- better build process, with sourcemap for production & non-minified JS for development
- SASS
- test suite template
